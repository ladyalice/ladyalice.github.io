Sometimes I think about time travel.\ You know, like real time travel.\ What if there are time travelers amoung us and we just don't know?\Or we just dont' believe.\ And, how do we know, maybe their world lines are different than ours so it is true in their world. \ Even if they're crazy, isn't reality a moldable string of ideas in each of our minds?\I.e.: How do you know you're even reading this? What if you're actually sleeping? \ Reading this janky file in Github. But really, you are about to wake up.\This idea, as many, perhaps all others, have been thought of at some point or another.
